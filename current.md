# My job?
I feel that if I'm going to name this page as I have, I should mention that I am currently employed.... I am officially a machine learning engineer, though I have yet to code any models. Mostly I advise folks about how to organize their annotations and their models based on linguistic principles and NLP best practice. My current crusade is support of stopword removal. (My coworkers don't know about the crusade. It's a sneeky one. Shhh.) 

I work on Xfinity Assistant and sometimes the X1 voice remote or the home IOT devices. Not the devices themselves of course-- the logic for them. 

Standard important disclaimer (maybe I need to make this more prominent...). Opinions are my own.
