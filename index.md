# Welcome

I'm putting up a quick website to help with my active job search. I'm a computational linguist looking for language-oriented data science or machine learning work in Portland, SF Bay, or wherever else I might have to move to start my career. I typed up a quick about page a while ago, and you'll find a link to that below. I also have a few projects to show off, and I'll start linking to those as I get more public facing commentary written. Meanwhile here are links to: 

  - [My resume](./Resume_6-6.pdf)
  - [My LinkedIn profile]( http://www.linkedin.com/in/kchalk)
  - [My favorite college project]( http://www.github.com/kchalk/RedditProject)
  - [The afore-mentioned About](./About.html).
