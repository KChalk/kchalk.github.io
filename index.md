# Welcome

I'm a computational linguist looking for language-oriented data science or machine learning work in Portland, SF Bay, or wherever else I might have to move to start my career. I have a few projects to show off, all of which are available on [my github](github.com/kchalk). I'll link to public facing explanations of these projects as I finish writing commentary. Meanwhile here are some links to: 

  - Profile information
    - [My resume](./Resume_6-6.pdf) (including contact info)
