# Miscellaneous almost published things.

## Describe a challenge you've encountered and how you overcame it. 
(Also: How and why I got into this field)

### Reflections on the question
I've recently developed a new theory on why I have trouble with this question. When asked, I tend to think only of challenges that were emotionally painful-- ie. things that did not go well at all. Thus my answer to how I overcame the challenge tends to be 1. mentally, 'I didn't I failed and it still plagues me to this day' and 2. aloud, 'mostly through perserverance. I kept attacking the problem from different angles, like chipping away at a brick wall with an ice pick, and eventually all my efforts converged in one place and the team and I acheived the results you see today.'

Any challenge I 'overcome' ceases to seem like a challenge to me. It was a problem and I solved it. I am a problem solver. Alternatively, it seemed like it was going to be hard, but I tried my best and it went really well so it wasn't that hard after all. You can see how this is helpful for neither my self confidence nor my potential employer's impression of me.

Now that I've noticed this and I am currently in the process of applying for my dream job, I thought I would write up a couple other answers.

### A problem I've solved

### A convergence of efforts

### Not so challenging after all

### The biggest brick wall of them all

In the first paragraph of this section, I included a metaphor that might have seemed a bit out of place. 'I kept attacking the problem from different angles, like chipping away at a brick wall with an ice pick.' 'Where did that come from?' you might wonder. 'Why are we talking about ice picks?' It came from my therapist. I have generalized anxeity disorder, you see, and have at times suffered from severe depression. When my depression was at its worst, when my best friend was suffering from post-partum psychosis and not really me friend and more, and in the last few months before my mother faked a suicide attempt and yelled at me for calling parametics in response, I was finishing my junior year at Reed College.
